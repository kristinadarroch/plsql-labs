Lab Instructions ←

When you run the sqlplus command from a directory, that directory becomes the home directory. Inside the SQL*Plus environment, you can access any file in the local directory by simply prefacing it with an “@“ symbol. If the file doesn’t exist it raises and exception.

You can check for the existence of the file with the following command:

SQL> !ls
It will display:

apply_oracle_lab1.sql
You call the file in sqlplus like this:

SQL> @apply_oracle_lab1.sql
It should contain the following two calls:

@/home/student/Data/cit325/oracle/lib/cleanup_oracle.sql
@/home/student/Data/cit325/oracle/lib/Oracle12cPLSQLCode/Introduction/create_video_store.sql
and they do the following:

The cleanup_oracle.sql script was written to cleanup an Oracle database schema while leaving an Oracle APEX 4 installation untouched. You will need to modify this script if you upgrade Oracle APEX 4.
The create_video_store.sql script was written for the Oracle Database 12c PL/SQL Programming book and creates a sample video store model for the book and these labs.
The create_video_store.sql script will display the following when it completes:
